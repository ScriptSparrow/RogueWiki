This tutorial covers item localization. Localization enables defining essential attributes for items or talents, such as DisplayName, Description, FlavorText, and icons.

1. Create a enGB.json file inside the localization folder of your mod

2. paste the following

{
	"strings": {
		"blank_name": {
			"Text": "text to fill"
		},
		"blank_name": {
			"Text": "text to fill"
		},
		"blank_name": {
			"Text": "text to fill"
		},
		"blank_name": {
			"Text": "text to fill"
		}
	}
}
	
	Note: While it is easy to add new strings, be aware that the last entry needs the , omitted.

3. open the blueprint you want to localize inside a text editor

4. scroll to m_DisplayName

5. Look for "m_Key": "This will display a lot of numbers",

6. Change it to something that is appropriate for what your editing, for example:
		"m_key": "NewBoltPistol_DisplayName"
		
7. Now edit the enGB.json file to give it an actual entry.

	{
		"strings": {
			"NewBoltPistol_DisplayName": {
				"Text": "New Bolt Pistol"
			}
		}
	}
	

8. Done

Other options are:

a. Description
b. FlavorText

Follow the same steps 1 to 8, however it is advised to keep your text clean, so you can read it back.
Example:

		"Grimflare_DisplayName": {
			"Text": "Grimflare"
		},
		"Grimflare_Description": {
			"Text": "This pistol deals energy damage and inflicts burning on its targets."
		},
		"Grimflare_FlavorText": {
			"Text": "Grimflare is equipped with a miniaturized plasma generator, which superheats the air around each shot, creating a radiant aura of heat. Designed for the Mechanicus, itâ€™s devastating against unarmored foes, searing flesh and bone with each shot."
		}
